Ribbon is an algebraic effects language in the lineage of
[Koka](https://koka-lang.github.io/) and [Effekt](https://effekt-lang.org/), striking a new balance between high level programmer experience and low level
systems access by adapting influences from the imperative world, inspired by a
history in game development.

Focal points of the design include:
+ Performance-friendly effect handlers
+ Structured allocation / allocator strategies
+ Embedding into other applications
+ Strong static types with full inference
+ Polymorphism for structural data and procedures
+ Deep extensibility in the style of
[Lisp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)) and
[Terra](https://terralang.org/)
